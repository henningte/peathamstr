  abstract = {Assessing carbon sink\textendash source relationships in peatlands must be based on the understanding of processes responsible for long-term carbon accumulation patterns. In contrast with ombrogeneous bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central Alberta, Canada. The \textasciitilde 8000-year chronology of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20 accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates. The paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse brown moss species and some Larix trees but was dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to 1300 calibrated years BP. The last 1300 years are characterized by the reappearance of Larix together with abundant woody materials and Cyperaceae, culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum nitens in the last several decades. During the Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation pattern derived from 15 14C dates and 260 bulk density measurements indicates declining mass accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age\textendash depth curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF data using an extended model incorporating variable peat addition rates (PAR) to the catotelm suggests a unidirectional sevenfold decrease in PAR from 191.8 to 26.0 g dry mass{$\cdot$}m\textendash 2{$\cdot$}year\textendash 1 during the \textasciitilde 5000-year ``convex period''. Decreasing vegetation production and (or) increasing acrotelm decomposition could have produced the convex pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the moisture-limited climate of the region and in peatlands that have a strong groundwater influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has important implications for building simulation models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon accumulation rate of 31.1 g C{$\cdot$}m\textendash 2{$\cdot$}year\textendash 1, ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C{$\cdot$}m\textendash 2{$\cdot$}year\textendash 1 during the last 8000 years. This large variation results from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation and short-term climate-induced accumulation ``pulses''. The results imply that in the absence of climatic change, peatlands with a convex accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity will decline faster than would be expected given the concave-pattern model.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach using basal peat ages and carbon (C) accumulation profiles from the world's major peatland regions to decompose C flux terms from time-dependent C pool data observed from peat cores. Our peat-data syntheses show that the total peat C pools are 547 GtC, 50 GtC, and 15 GtC for northern, tropical and southern peatlands, respectively. The modeled net C balance (NCB) has a mean value of 41.8 TgC/yr for northern peatlands during the Holocene, ranging from 83.1 TgC/yr in the early Holocene around 9 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP) to 21.5 TgC/yr around 2 ka, a temporal pattern mostly owing to the delayed effect of long-term decay of previously accumulated peat C. NCB from tropical and southern peatlands represents much smaller terms, mostly less than 10 TgC/yr. Northern peatlands represent about 90\% of global total peatland C pool of 612 GtC and {$>$}90\% of global peatland NCB. Our bottom-up global peatland synthesis indicates a decrease in rates of peatland area expansion and reduced CH               4               emissions during the late Holocene, thus lending support for an anthropogenic source of late-Holocene CH               4               rise. The C balance analysis of global peatland data indicates a cumulative net C uptake of 272 GtC in the early Holocene (11\textendash 7 ka), 151 GtC at 7\textendash 4 ka, and 116 GtC after 4 ka. The large cumulative fluxes and significant variations throughout the Holocene could greatly contribute to the observed atmospheric CO               2               and {$\delta$}               13               CO               2               patterns derived from Antarctic ice cores. Thus, global mass-balance calculations or climate\textendash carbon cycle simulations have to consider these large net C uptake terms from global peatlands and their variations over the Holocene.},
